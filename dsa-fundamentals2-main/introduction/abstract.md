ADTs are entities that are defination of data and operation but do not have implementation idea. Simply if we say, abstract data type is an idea that can be implemented in differet way. But the actual idea not change

[Abstract Data Types(ADT) in Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0e27Cpc88E)

_abstract / logical view_

- store set of elements
- searching on elements
- sorting the elements
- adding item in elements
- removing item
- merging elements
- print item

_implementation idea_

- list = [10, 20, 30]
- print(list[0])
- list.append(value)
- list.remove(20)

implemention idea is different from language to language
